# About
This project focuses on water contamination issues that affect Chicago residents and natural spaces. Why does Chicago have the most lead pipes of any city in the US, and how are social groups and civic bodies addressing this challenge? What are the implications of Chicago’s water infrastructure for health and agriculture?

# Deliverables
**Data Analysis**
The project we’ll be looking into this year will be on Chicago water quality, with the main focus being lead contamination. We’ll divide into smaller subgroups, with each one focusing on an individual topic to investigate and analyze, similar to last year. Our role, as leaders, will be to teach new members with no data science experience how to code, and to integrate those members into the smaller working groups as we guide the groups towards deliverables.  Potential data sources will include the City of Chicago data portal and independent research.  Members should expect to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of data science and analysis, and will learn how to present their findings in a formal format, along with a body of projects to showcase. Training in data analysis, python, data visualization, and various software (git, Jupyter, etc.) will be provided.

**Community Outreach**
The ERG’s Community Outreach team will create and distribute a survey to residents of different Chicago neighborhoods to gain insight into what community members know about lead in Chicago drinking water and hear how this issue affects their lives. We also hope to go out into the community to talk to those affected by lead pollution, hear their concerns, and help them test their water for lead. We would also like to interview various organizations involved in this issue. Ultimately, we will produce a report based on the results of the survey and our interviews with community organizations.

**Policy**
The policy group plans to focus on Chicago-specific water quality policies, with a specialized focus on lead poisoning,  regulated by both the city and the Illinois Pollution Control Board. We aim to analyze both its objectives and results in correlation to the U.S. Clean Water Act, and offer insight and suggestions on how policies in Chicago can better complement the principles of the CWA, and provide a healthy water source for its residents and surrounding environment.
