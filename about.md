<!-- Content One -->
<p>The Environmental Research Group is an undergraduate science and policy think tank devoted to interfacing science and social good to create sustainable change in Chicago through applicable, data-driven modeling. Science can oftentimes be void of application to the real world. So, the ERG was created to help build the bridge between data-driven solutions and real-world impact.</p>
