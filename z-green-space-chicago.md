# About
This project focuses specifically on trying to quantify the connection between green space, access to green space, and environmental justice issues in Chicago. Previous research has shown that such heterogeneous distributions of space uphold environmental racism. Can we find a causal link in Chicago? Is green space really that important? What are possible solutions to the lack of equitable green space distribution in Chicago?

# Deliverables
* Proposal for improving green space access in Chicago in the next 5 years. 
* Summary document of interviews with community organizations dedicated to expanding green space.
* Visualizations and maps of current and historical green space and the tree canopy of Chicago.
