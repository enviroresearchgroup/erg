# About
This project is working at the intersection of air quality, transportation, and COVID-19 in the City of Chicago. The change in behavior from the pandemic has created a unique public transportation dataset, representing only the essential trips people have to make. Insights from this data will be used to recommend public transportation upgrades and highlight the air quality benefits this new infrastructure would bring.

# Deliverables
* Identify and visualize key shifts in transit usage due to stay-at-home orders
* White paper on line extension and air pollution mitigation
* Communicate policy plans with community and constraining given input
